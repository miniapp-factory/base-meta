#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### all transactions , volume , news and so many things going on base will be available on base-meta . Everybody has access to it and don't have to use multiple webs or apps for these metrics  
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` values to reflect the new app description.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create this new file to describe the logo that should be generated.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized representation of the Base-Meta logo featuring a bold, modern shield shape in deep blue, with a subtle gradient from navy to teal. Inside the shield, a white stylized 'B' and 'M' interlock, forming a dynamic, forward‑moving arrow pointing upward. The background is a clean, light gray gradient, giving the logo a sleek, professional look suitable for a tech dashboard.
